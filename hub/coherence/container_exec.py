# // spec: coh-rt-01, coh-rt-02, coh-rt-05, coh-rt-07, coh-id-04, coh-dec-04
"""Host-side containerized execution driver (`--launch-config`).

Validates the launch configuration OUTSIDE the container against the
execution-profile registry (coh-rt-02: a container never self-certifies;
coh-id-04: the declared profile and platform manifest digest must resolve and
match the registry), rewrites the request so every root points at its
container mount target, and executes the pinned image under the launcher's
enforced flag set (coh-rt-01, coh-rt-05, coh-rt-07).

The rewritten request is staged INSIDE the output directory (bound at
/output): the in-container CLI emits every envelope beside its request file,
so staging there is what makes in-container error envelopes reach the host
through the single designated output bind. `request.outputs` names the
HOST-side output directory; inside the container it is always rewritten to
/output. The output directory must be readable and writable by the container
user.

Every failure mode maps onto the frozen exit-code contract (coh-dec-04):
a launch that fails validation never reaches assertions (exit 30, ERROR
class); a container killed for exceeding its time or output limits is
incomplete execution (exit 32 — coh-rt-05: exhaustion is ERROR, never PASS);
a completed container whose exit code and result bundle disagree — or whose
exit code is not a contract code at all (podman-level failure) — is ERROR
(coh-dec-01: disagreement is never resolved in favor of the permissive
signal). A coherent completed run relays the container's own exit code and
canonical result untouched.
