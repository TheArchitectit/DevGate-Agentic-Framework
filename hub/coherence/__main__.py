"""CLI entry point: python -m hub.coherence --request request.json

Time and stage come only from the evaluation context, never the host clock.
Exit codes per the frozen decision/exit matrix. Stdlib-only.

Request is validated against request.schema.json at entry (S3): a malformed
request yields the invalid-input envelope, never a raw traceback (r3-indep).

From Stage 2 fresh-promotion onward, a signed detached attestation binds the
canonical decision to all input digests (coh-ev-01, coh-ev-05). The attestation
is a detached object; the canonical decision carries no attestation fields.
