# Changelog

All notable changes to the DevGate Agentic Framework will be documented in this file.

and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.0.0] - 2026-09-11

### Added

- First tagged release, cut as part of the guardrails control-plane
  architecture so consumers can pin DevGate as a versioned submodule instead of
  vendoring drifting copies.
- Static/CI quality gates: pattern and semantic scans, regression check, test
  isolation, deploy gate, and drift scans, with GitHub workflow templates and a
  runner under `templates/`.
- Policy skill templates under `templates/skills/` (Four Laws, halt conditions,
  production-first, scope validator, three strikes, commit validator). The
  canonical versions of these rules now live in
  [guardrail-policy-packs](https://github.com/TheArchitectit/guardrail-policy-packs)
  (`core/` pack v1.0.0); the copies here remain for compatibility until
  consumers migrate to pinned packs.
