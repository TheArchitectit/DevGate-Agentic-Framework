"""Guards for the mutation harness the batteries run on.

Deliberately carries no `// spec:` marker. The convention means "this file
covers that requirement", and no requirement in `openspec/specs/` is about
mutation testing — marking it against a change-package id that is not published
yet would manufacture coverage, which is the thing the marker is supposed to
measure.

The three `mutation_battery_*.py` files each decide whether a guard is
load-bearing: mutate, run a named test, report killed or survived. Each carried
its own private copy of the machinery that reads that verdict — three places
for the same answer to be wrong, and no place that noticed if it were.

Consolidating them into `tests/mutation_harness.py` removes the copies and adds
exactly one place to be wrong — so the verdict logic is pinned here instead of
inferred from the batteries passing. A harness that read a mutant's SyntaxError
as "a test caught it", or a stale anchor as a kill, would turn every battery
green while proving nothing. `scripts/mutation_check.py` carries the same guard
for the same reason: "a mutation tool that silently misreports is itself an
evaluator integrity failure."

These drive the real harness against a synthetic repository whose outcomes are
known by construction.
