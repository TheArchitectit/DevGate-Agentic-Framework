# // spec: coh-int-07 — the runbook layer is part of the S6 operational
# closure this line demanded ("migration guide + operator runbook"); this
# file is what keeps its claims from rotting into prose.
"""Runbook claim-pinning: the docs under `docs/runbooks/` are operational
promises, so the parts of them a test can check get checked.

Three claim classes, chosen because each has already rotted somewhere in
this repo's history (a runbook citing a dead exit code is worse than none):

1. **Behavior coverage.** The S6 line names four behaviors — outage,
   mirror (pinned image), cached-attestation, protocol-mismatch — and
   each must have a NAMED HOME: a runbook file containing anchor strings
   only that behavior's docs should carry. An anchor list is written OUT
   here (importing it from anywhere would let it shrink in silence).
2. **Exit-code truth.** Every coherence exit code cited in a runbook
   (`exit 3x`/`exit 40`/`exit 20`/`exit 10` — the watchdog's 0/1 are
   spoke-script codes, not coherence codes, so the range separates them
   cleanly) must equal the constant `hub/coherence/result.py` defines,
   read live from the module rather than transcribed.
3. **Migration anchors + index integrity.** The migration guide's named
   units, paths, and function must exist verbatim in the scripts it
   points at, and README.md's table must index exactly the runbook files
   on disk, each with a non-empty scenario column.

Dual-runnable: pytest collects test_*; `python3 tests/test_runbook_claims.py`
runs them too.
