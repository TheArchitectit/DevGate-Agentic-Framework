"""The re-pin harness: a throwaway git repository the operation runs against.

`scripts/re-pin-evaluator-identity.sh` is an OPERATOR tool — it commits — so
testing it means giving it a repository to commit in. This builds one: a real
temporary git repo carrying only the two files the operation edits, plus a
`bin/` of stubs (`curl` answering the registry's token and manifest endpoints,
`podman` answering a digest NO registry serves) prepended to PATH.

It lives here rather than in the suite for two reasons. It is a fixture, and
this is where ten other suites keep theirs (`tests/fixtures/coherence/`). And
the suite that used to hold it inline crossed the repository's 600-line hard
limit for test files when the exit-6 test was added — the honest response to
that gate being to stop growing the file rather than to move the limit.

The stubs are deliberately hostile rather than convenient: the podman stub
reports a local-storage digest no registry serves, so a run that resolved the
identity through podman instead of the registry API would record that value
and be visible.

Deterministic and hermetic: no network, no host clock, and an identity
supplied through the environment (see `identity()`), so nothing here depends
on whichever git config the machine happens to have.

    Two reasons this is not optional, and the second is why it must be the
    environment rather than config:

    * Hermeticity. These tests commit — the fixtures do, and the operation
      under test does. A suite that passes only because the operator's
      ~/.gitconfig happens to carry a user.name is not testing the operation;
      on a runner with no such config every one of those commits fails. That
      is not hypothetical: run 36061428590 failed 3 tests with
      `fatal: empty ident name (for <runner@…>) not allowed` and the
      operation's exit 6, while the same suite was green locally.
    * The fixtures read no config at all (`GIT_CONFIG_GLOBAL=/dev/null`), so
      `user.name` in a config file would not be read even if it existed. Git
      consults GIT_AUTHOR_*/GIT_COMMITTER_* before any config, which is the
      one channel that reaches every git process here, ours and the script's.
