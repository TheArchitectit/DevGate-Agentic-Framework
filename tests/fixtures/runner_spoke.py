"""The fake runner host this suite enrolls against.

`scripts/runner-enroll.sh` generates systemd units, an EnvironmentFile and a
heartbeat helper, then starts them with systemctl. Testing that means giving it
a host to do it on. This is that host: HOME inside a tmp directory, `curl` and
`systemctl` stubbed at the front of PATH, and no network, no real systemd and
no real hub anywhere in it.

The curl stub is a router, not a recorder: it answers /enroll, /heartbeat and
/revoke the way the hub does, deriving the issued token from the runner name so
that two enrollments provably differ, and appending every request to a log the
tests assert against.

It lives here rather than in the suite because it is a fixture and this is
where the repository keeps them (`tests/fixtures/repin.py` is the sibling), and
because the suite that used to hold it inline crossed the 600-line hard limit
for test files — the honest response to that gate being to stop growing the
file rather than to move the limit.
