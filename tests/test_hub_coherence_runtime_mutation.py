"""Mid-run input mutation (S8 tasks.md:919, measured 2026-09-26): design.md §2
commits to "Snapshots or re-verifies digests at evaluator read time; mutation
mid-run is ERROR (exit 32), never a mixed-content pass", and the exit-32
matrix row names "input mutation" — but the guarantee was documented, not
shipped: `manifest.verify_read` had zero production callers and a probe
showed an evaluator silently reading mutated bytes (a clean VIOLATED computed
from post-snapshot content). The closure re-verifies the closed snapshot
after the last evaluator read (`manifest.first_mutation`): ANY tree move —
replace, delete, add, or a mutation that makes the tree unbuildable — is
ERROR-execution. All fixtures synthetic (R9)."""
