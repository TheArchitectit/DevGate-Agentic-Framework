"""The shipped secret-scanning template must enforce the contract this repo runs.

The template previously told consumers to run `gitleaks/gitleaks-action@v2` on a
hosted runner — a marketplace action, a licence question for organisations, and
a different mechanism from anything this repository exercised — while two of its
three other jobs printed the matched line (republishing the secret) and never
failed the build. It looked like protection and was not.

Two kinds of assertion live here, and the difference matters:

  * Static ones over the PARSED workflow — which actions run, and whether the
    template's scanner version and checksum match this repository's own CI. A
    comment that names a removed action is documentation, not a dependency, so
    these read the parsed document rather than the file text.

  * Behavioural ones that execute the step bodies with stubbed tools. Text
    assertions are how this suite first went wrong: a mutation that turns a
    guard into `if false;` leaves every string it asserted on exactly where it
    was, and the suite stayed green while the guard was dead. Four such
    mutations survived the first draft of this file. So the checks that protect
    a consumer — the fetch that must not happen when a scanner is present, the
    checksum that must reject wrong bytes, the gate that must be present, the
    scope line that must appear, the .env job that must fail — are run, not
    read.

The parse behind the first kind is `parse_workflow` below, not a YAML library.
This file first imported PyYAML, and the hosted test lane — which installs pytest
and nothing else — died at collection with `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named
'yaml'`, taking every other test with it. A test-only dependency that breaks the
whole lane when it is absent is a worse trade than a reader for the one shape
this repository actually writes; `scripts/detect-host-ci.py` reads workflow files
the same way, for the same reason. A hand-rolled reader can fail quietly by
finding nothing, so setUp asserts the parse found the jobs and steps it expects —
otherwise a reader that returned empty would turn every assertion below into a
vacuous pass.
