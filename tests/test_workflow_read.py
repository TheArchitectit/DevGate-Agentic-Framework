"""Guards for the workflow reader the publish-trigger checks rest on.

`tests/workflow_read.py` reads `.github/workflows/*.yml` structurally, without
PyYAML. That is not a stylistic preference: the hosted lane installs only pytest
(`.github/workflows/ci.yml`, "Install pytest"), so a module-level `import yaml`
anywhere in `tests/` aborts collection and takes the whole suite down with it —
which is exactly what happened on the first push of this guard, and what
`add-secret-scanning` tasks 6.3 already records as a failure mode ("a test-only
dependency that takes the whole suite down when it is missing"). The repository
owns no PyYAML dependency at all; `parse_workflow` in
`test_secret_validation_template.py` reads the same file the same way for the
same reason.

Replacing a real parser with a narrow reader is only safe if the narrow reader
is exercised, so the reader is pinned here rather than inferred from the guard
that uses it. Two properties matter, and they are different:

  * it READS what this repository actually writes — a reader that choked on the
    live ci.yml would report the publish guard as unable to run, and a reader
    that quietly returned an empty tree would make every assertion about a
    missing job look satisfied by a missing job;
  * it REJECTS what it cannot follow — the same reader backs the mutation
    harness's "did this mutation break the file" check, and a reader that
    accepted anything would report a YAML mutation that breaks parsing as a
    mutation a test killed.

Deliberately carries no `// spec:` marker: no requirement in `openspec/specs/`
is about reading workflows, and marking this against a change-package id that is
not published yet would manufacture the coverage the marker is meant to measure.
