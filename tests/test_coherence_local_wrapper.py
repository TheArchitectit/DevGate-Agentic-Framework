# // spec: coh-int-01, coh-int-05
"""Local developer command (scripts/coherence-local) vs the CI template.

coh-int-01's byte-equivalence promise has two halves: the CI invocation
(template) and the local command must produce *the same bytes* for the same
inputs. What this suite pins for coh-int-05 is narrower than the requirement's
whole surface — no adapter may reinterpret or downgrade a canonical decision:
the wrapper is checked to relay the service's exit verbatim and to surface a
builder refusal as ERROR-class 30, never default-allow green. The
requirement's timeout scenario belongs to the service/driver, already tested
in the exit-code sweep; nothing here re-pins it. The builder (hub/coherence/invoke.py) is already one implementation
shared by both — this suite pins the SHELL half: that the local wrapper's
actual emitted request.json / launch.json are byte-identical to what the
template's own command, replayed verbatim, emits.

Why "replayed verbatim" and not a copy: round-18 D1 was a CI heredoc drifting
from the contract while a text-matching test watched. A test that hand-copied
the template's command lines would be a third implementation of the same
invocation and could drift from BOTH. So the builder command is extracted from
the template file at test time — if the template changes its flags, the replay
changes too, and any wrapper that did not follow fails here. That is what
makes every byte comparison killable rather than decorative.

Real container execution of the driver step is deliberately NOT asserted as
equivalent: it requires the image to match the identity registry (publish-gated
re-pin, tasks.md round-18). What this suite DOES pin, including that step: the
wrapper's two subprocess commands are the template's two commands, same flags,
same order — verified from the wrapper's --dry-run transcript against the
template-extracted command forms.

    A driver run FAILs (exit 20) and a clean PASS exits 0; the service already
    maps every container outcome onto the frozen contract (coh-dec-04), so the
    wrapper's only job is relaying the number unchanged — a `return 0` there,
    or any re-mapping, turns real failures green locally.

    Runs the wrapper's own commands with `python3` resolved to a stub that
    plays the service (builder succeeds, driver exits 20), so the relay is
    observed without the publish-gated image. The driver command is taken from
    the wrapper's --dry-run transcript, so this tests the same argv the
    real run uses — not a copy the test invented.

    The stub passes ANY non-service invocation through to the real
    interpreter. Without that, the wrapper's own shebang (`env python3`) hits
    the stub and the stub's exit-20 fires for the wrapper itself — the first
    version of this test passed that way, vacuously: both driver mutants
