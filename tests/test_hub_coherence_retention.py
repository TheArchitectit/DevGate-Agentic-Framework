# // spec: coh-ev-04
"""Authorized input retention (coh-ev-04): where reproduction needs the exact
subject bytes, the immutable input bundle is preserved on a channel SEPARATE
from public evidence, retrievable only under an authorization distinct from
evidence-read access, and expiry (evaluated against a trusted time, never the
host clock) invalidates cache reuse for the affected identities.

Public evidence proves a finding with digests + minimum-disclosure excerpts and
needs no retrieval secret to read. This channel holds the raw input bytes, so
it is gated by its own HMAC-capability token (a control-plane secret the
evidence reader does not hold) and its own lifetime. All fixtures synthetic
(R9); time is always an explicit `as_of`, never datetime.now().
