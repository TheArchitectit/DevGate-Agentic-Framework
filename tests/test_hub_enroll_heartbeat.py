"""Tests for hub/server.py (Sprint 2.3): enroll -> heartbeat -> stale cycle.

Spawns a fixture hub on an EPHEMERAL port (bind 0, read back) so tests never
collide with each other or with a real hub. Locks mon-enroll-01 (one-time
enrollment token, per-runner heartbeat token, revoke) and the /health
dead-man-switch endpoint shape.

Dual-runnable: pytest collects test_*; `python3 tests/test_hub_enroll_heartbeat.py` runs them too.
