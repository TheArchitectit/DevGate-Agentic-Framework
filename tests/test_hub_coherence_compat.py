"""Compatibility and schema versioning (S8 tasks.md:920, measured 2026-09-26;
acceptance criterion 1 of 12, plus the Stage-2 no-regression boundary from 8).

Criterion 1 — "all normative schemas are versioned and published with
compatibility tests". Measured before this suite: the schemas DID carry
versions (a wire `api_version` const, or the package's `schema_version`), and
the wire schemas WERE validated against emitted results — but nothing asserted
the pair of properties that makes a version a version: that EVERY normative
schema declares one in a recognized place, and that a FOREIGN or MISSING
version is refused rather than parsed under this version's rules and
mis-judged. A conformance suite that is green over an unversioned family is the
same shape as the mid-run-mutation gap: a documented contract with no enforcing
test.

This is a TEST-ONLY slice: the version refusals it pins were already built (the
measurement found them, it did not create them). What is new is that the
contract is pinned, parameterized over the normative family, with anti-vacuity
guards — so a future schema cannot join the family unversioned, and a future
"be liberal, default a missing version to v1" change fails here.

One genuine annotation the measurement surfaced, recorded by name rather than
silently passed: `execution-profiles.schema.json` names itself with
`schema: "execution-profiles"` — a shape discriminator, not a version. The
other fourteen all carry a version, split across two roads (an in-document
`const`, or the `title` family string), so "versioned" is checked per schema
and never inferred from the majority.

All fixtures synthetic (R9).
